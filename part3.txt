    1. Node.js Event Loop
The Event Loop allows Node.js to run asynchronous code without blocking the main thread by executing callbacks when the call stack is empty

2. libuv
libuv is a C library that provides Node.js with the event loop, asynchronous I/O, and a thread pool for heavy operations.

3. Asynchronous Operations in Node.js
Node.js sends async tasks to libuv, continues executing other code, and runs the callback later when the task is finished.


4. Call Stack vs Event Queue vs Event Loop
The Call Stack runs JavaScript code, the Event Queue holds completed async callbacks, and the Event Loop moves callbacks to the stack.


5. Node.js Thread Pool
The thread pool is used for heavy tasks like file system and crypto operations. The default size is 4 and can be changed using UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE.


6. Blocking vs Non-Blocking Code
Blocking code stops the event loop and delays all requests, while non-blocking code allows Node.js to handle multiple operations efficiently
